## About Book Randomizer
As a reader, sometimes I'm not sure what to read next because I have so many amazing books on my list!
<br>
So I had the idea to build this app to help me in this task. I wanted to be able to create my own list and then randomly generate
a book to read next and also have predefined lists in case I wanted a surprise.
<br>
Hope this helps other book lovers choose what to read next. 🧚‍♀️ 🥰
